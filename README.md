# Vocals4Local_App


With the colossal volume of new music being uploaded on streaming services daily, the voices of local musicians, especially those performing in regional languages, are getting drowned out. We present a unique online music app, Vocals4Locals, for budding local musicians to showcase their work. 

The app will primarily cater to two kinds of users, the artists who will upload their work, and the consumers who will stream the music. The users will first be required to register or login once they arrive on the landing page. Once the user has logged in, they will be given a list of artists whose song they can stream categorised on the basis of language and location. The musicians will have the additional feature of uploading their songs. On the back-end the app will maintain two significant databases, one of all users, and second of the songs being uploaded by the artist.

We will develop the app on Android Studios, using the programming language Java. The app will be supported on Android Jelly Bean and above. We will use Pixel 3a or Nexus 5 for the emulator.
